### Nice to meet you! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=EllaRekow.EllaRekow)

I'm a computer science major at Morgan State University who loves to code and figure out new ways to solve real world problems.

**What's in store for me?**

- This upcoming semester, my classes are focus around data structures and algorithmic programs
- I'm working on a Discord bot in my free time and also have some other projects that I'm planning
- I'm making music!
